you think about the courses and knowledge you received in college. 
If think of it patiently, you’ll find out that you may be kind of outdated 
in terms of what we are doing nowadays.

### Why Being Certified Is Important?
I already gave you the first reason, but having a degree on something I 
know probes that are a professional, but it definitely makes you growth 
professionally.

Have ever though of people that received promotions or 
raises more frequently? Well, getting certificate shows 
your ambitions and that is really important for employers 
that are always looking for the best people out there.

### How To Prepare For A Certification Exam?
Months ago I took and cleared my first certification exam wit. 
It was the [CCA175][CCA175]{:target="_blank"} from Cloudera 
which is considered by some people to be extremely hard to pass.
When got the certificate many of my co-workers asked me how 
I could passed the exam without having training. In this post, 
I’ll try to give you some advice on how to getting prepare for 
a exam with out taking some external training that have their 
associated cost.

### Plan
Start by taking a look on what are you going to be probed.
Every exam has its topics, even better, some of the providers
will give a list of topics and subtopics in a good explained way.
Just take a look at the [70-483][70-483]{:target="_blank"}
certification exam offered by Microsoft which one of the 
certification exams I’m planning to take within the next months.

### Prepare On Every Topic
Once you have and know the list of topics, concentrate
in one at a time, don’t try to cover everything in 
one study session.

Find the resources that will let you understand every 
aspect of every topic. Study and make sure you had 
understood the basic concepts and how to use them 
in real scenarios.

Something I consider important is not to study just because
you want to pass the exam, study because you want to 
understand and put in practice what you are studying.
Make notes of those aspects that you consider important 
and don’t want to miss when you go over the next topic.

If you don’t understand something, go to other resources 
and read them ,if are you still not sure you understand, 
try to find some person that may have that knowledge either 
in your work or in one of the many specialized forums over the internet.

### Hands On Practice On Every Topic
Once you have gone over some topic, 
try to resolve exercises that require those skills.
Practice makes perfect!

Some of the resources that prepare you for this 
kind of exams have exercises at the end of every chapter. 
Took them! Some of them might not have the difficulty 
level of the questions that will be in the real exam, 
but definitely will help you to familiarize with them.

Gather a few questions from different sources, put 
them together, and try to solve all of them with 
out taking any help from external distractions or notes. 
This will make you gain the confidence you need for 
the exam and give you a more like taking the exam experience.

### Overall Practice
Once you have finished your study and practice on 
every topic, try to emulate the environment you’ll 
find in the real exam.

At this point you may feel like you have understood and
remember every topic and don’t see helpful taking the 
same questions you already took. Well, sort them out 
by topic, take some for each of them, setup a timer 
(you can use either your watch or one of those online timers, 
but I encourage you to use something more visible and 
less distracting, I found [this][TimeTimer]{:target="_blank"} 
to be a great tool, give it a try) and try to solve them again,
I assure you that this exercise you help you a lot. 
You’ll find out that time management is the key for these exams.

Go to Google and try to find websites that offer you 
exams with similar or the same questions. 
Many of the exam providers publish some similar 
exams just to give you an idea of what you might expect.
Take them!

### Before Taking The Exam
I know some people that feel better working or 
studying under stress and they prefer to pay for 
the exam before start studying. I tried to do that 
and failed, even considering I feel sometimes being 
a procrastinator. We are all different and if you 
prepare after paying for the exam that’s fine but 
think of any blocker or impediment that you might 
encounter within that period.

The day before the exam try not to push yourself 
and instead of going to your room and study hard, 
try to take a look at your notes making sure you have 
everything cover. If you have already prepared well you 
should not have anything to worry about. You have studied smart not hard.

### Taking The Exam
The day of the exam try to arrive some minutes early so
you can explore your assigned area. Some of the exam 
providers don’t let you wear some accessories like watches 
or bracelets so be prepared in case they ask you to put something off.

I hope at this point you feel comfortable with yourself 
and just want to show what you have learned during your 
preparation period. Take the exam as you took your practice test.
Focus on every question no more that the necessary, 
you don’t want to spend 20 minutes in just one question, 
what matters is that you pass the exam. You’ll get a certificate 
whether you answer all the questions correctly or just the 
necessary to pass the exam.

Hope you have found this post helpful, 
I’ll keep adding more points while preparing for my next 
certification exam.
